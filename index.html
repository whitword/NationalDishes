        <li>It is a staple food, made from a selection of locally available foodstuffs that can be prepared in a distinctive way</li>
        <li>It contains a particular ingredient that is produced locally</li>
        <li>It is served as a festive culinary tradition that forms part of a cultural heritage</li>
        <li>It has been promoted as a national dish, by the country itself</li>
